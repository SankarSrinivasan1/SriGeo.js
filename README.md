# SriGeo.js

SriGeo.js is a geolocation-based JavaScript library that offers advanced location tracking and geofencing functionalities. It provides developers with the ability to create location-aware applications, track users' movements, define virtual boundaries (geofences), and trigger custom actions based on proximity to specific locations. SriGeo.js opens up possibilities for location-based gaming, personalized marketing, and smart city applications.

## Features

- **Location Tracking**: Track and monitor the user's current location in real-time.
- **Geofencing**: Create virtual boundaries around specific locations and receive notifications when the user enters or exits these geofences.
- **Custom Actions**: Define custom actions to be triggered when the user enters or exits a geofence.
- **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two sets of latitude and longitude coordinates using the Haversine formula.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully when retrieving geolocation information.

## Getting Started
### Installation

You can install SriGeo.js via npm

### Usage
To use SriGeo.js in your JavaScript project, follow these steps:

1. Import the SriGeo module:

```javascript
import SriGeo from 'sri-geo';
```

2. Instantiate a new SriGeo object:

```javascript
const geo = new SriGeo();
```

3. Start tracking the user's location:

```javascript
geo.startTracking(
  (latitude, longitude) => {
    // Handle the user's location update
    // Perform actions based on the user's location
  },
  (error) => {
    // Handle geolocation retrieval errors
  }
);
```

4. Create geofences:

```javascript
// Example geofence setup
geo.createGeofence(
  targetLatitude,
  targetLongitude,
  radius,
  () => {
    // Perform custom action when the user enters the geofence
  },
  () => {
    // Perform custom action when the user exits the geofence
  }
);
```

5. Stop tracking the user's location (optional):

```javascript
geo.stopTracking();
```
